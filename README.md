Knowledge Graph Identification
============================

This repository contains code and pointers to data to enable you to re-create the results from Knowledge Graph Identification experiments in our papers. Since this project is under active development, we've created a separate git branch for each paper to provide the code associated with the experiments. Furthermore, since the datasets we use can be large, we'll provide a link to a tarball with the data we use for the experiment. 

Below is a list of papers and the associated git branch to checkout for the experiments.
